Ravichandran Ashwin is one of the most successful test bowlers from India claiming more than
350 international wickets. He has been spearheading the spin attack for the Indian test team since his
debut in November 2011 and is expected to make a dash to 400 wickets in the upcoming test series with
New Zealand. However, some exciting new spinning prospects have also staked their claim for the test
team.

As a selector you are aware about non subcontinent pitches being non-spin friendly which
reduces the number of slots for spinners in the team. Being an ex-player, you also know how important
toss is in test matches since it dictates whether a team will bat first or not. The decision to bat or bowl
first can have significant import on the final outcome of a match.

You have decided to construct a Bayesian Network to help you with your conundrum and help
you with your decision on Ashwinâ€™s selection for the upcoming tour.
